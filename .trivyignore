# CRITICAL: Network ACL rule allows access using ALL ports.
# Ensure access to specific required ports is allowed, and nothing else.

# CRITICAL: Security group rule allows unrestricted egress to any IP address.
# Opening up ports to connect out to the public internet is generally to be
# avoided. You should restrict access to IP addresses or ranges that are
# explicitly required where possible.

# HIGH: Security group rule allows unrestricted ingress from any IP address.
# Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS
# resources. It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access to
# remote server administration ports, such as SSH to port 22 and RDP to port 3389.

# MEDIUM: VPC does not have VPC Flow Logs enabled.
# VPC Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC
# and can be used to detect anomalous tra ffic or insight during security workflows.

# MEDIUM: Network ACL rule allows unrestricted ingress from any IP address.
# The Network Access Control List (NACL) function provide stateless filtering
# of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that
# no NACL allows unrestricted ingress access to remote server administration
# ports, such as SSH to port 22 and RDP to port 3389.
